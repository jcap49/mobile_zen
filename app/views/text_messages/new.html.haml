      Welcome to Bonsai.

      What's on your mind?

      %p#slug_description
        Bonsai is a simple tool for daily reflection. Delivered at a selected time, a text message greets you with a question or quotation of your choosing to reflect on. Take as long, or as little as youâ€™d like.

          Your current text message reads 
          %span
            ="'#{@saved_text_message.text_body}'"
          and will be sent daily to
          %span
            =@saved_text_message.phone_number
          at 
          %span
            =@saved_text_message.send_time.strftime("%H:%M") + "."
      %p#text_limit_message
        Unfortunately there's a one text message limit per user at the moment. Feel free to reply with 'DELETE' to delete your current message - you can then create a new message of your choosing while logged in here.
